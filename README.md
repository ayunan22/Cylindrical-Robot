# Cylindrical-Robot
A desktop-sized cylindrical robot arm designed for precision pick-and-place tasks. Mechanical parts were modeled in SolidWorks, while forward and inverse kinematics were analyzed and simulated using MATLAB. This project demonstrates core concepts in robotic motion planning and transformation matrices.
